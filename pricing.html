faq:
  - question: Why charge for a free program?
    answer: "We ask for a $200 deposit, which is fully refundable after attending every live session and completing a portfolio project, which you can add to your resume."
  - question: How will I know if I'll get my refund?
    answer: "The bar for getting a refund is low by design.  Just make sure to show up for each live session and have something tangible to show at the end of the 12 weeks and you'll be refunded."
  - question: What types of payment do you accept?
    answer: "PayPal, Venmo, or credit card."
  - question: What if I can't afford $200?
    answer: "Remember that completing the program will earn yourself a full refund.  However, if the price is an issue, you can contact us and may work something out."
